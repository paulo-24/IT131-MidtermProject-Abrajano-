                <p>
                    June 15, 2022. Me and My Family visited this resort as it was so hype in social media. When we came their I was amazed by the view and also 
                    the water because you can see the sand under it. The Tubo Tubo beach resort is located in Tungawan with 2hours drive from zamboanga city and 17kms from main highway of tungawan.
                   Tubo-Tubo is one of the famous beach in Zamboanga Sibugay. The Tubo-Tubo Beach Resort has a crystal-clear water as you can see
                   in the picture and indeed is beautiful.

                <h2>Buluan Island: a Beach Destination in Zamboanga Sibugay</h2>
                <img src="/Images/buluan.jpg">
                <p>
                    January 22, 2022. Me and my family visited this Island and luckily, Me and my Family are the only people to be there at that time
                    because we go there early in the morning. White sand beaches and crystal-clear waters may be found on Buluan Island. Buluan Island 
                    can provide solitude and peace, even though the uncombed sand isn't exceptionally fine and powdery. Although the island is privately 
                    owned, no visitors are charged an admission fee. The island is not yet developed commercially. Visitors should buy food and beverages
                     from the town because there are neither resorts nor restaurants on the island. Visitors can use the bamboo tables and bungalows without 
                     paying anything. At the capital town of Ipil, one need not to go far just to have a taste of what Zamboanga Sibugay has to offer. 
                    Located some 7 kilometers from the port of Ipil, Buluan Island is a famous beach destination among Sibugaynons and 
                    is now slowly gaining popularity in nearby towns and provinces.
